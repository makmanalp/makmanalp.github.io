has been <a class="reference external" href="http://bostinno.streetwise.co/2014/05/12/satanic-black-mass-at-harvard-on-monday-may-12-reactions/">in the news</a> recently, with a lot of discussion and a minor outcry,
decrying the event as offensive, abhorrent, disgusting, a mockery of the
sacred, and ultimately as hate speech disguised in the cloak of learning. As
I&#8217;m tired of reading through comment box warfare, I&#8217;d like to further the
discussion a bit with my own&nbsp;perspective.</p>
<div class="section" id="which-satan">
<h2>Which&nbsp;Satan?</h2>
<p>It seems to me that Satanism is a single name for many quite different but
related things, so it&#8217;s hard to speak about it in general terms and have it be
universally applicable. Even with those branches that have something resembling
a canon, it doesn&#8217;t seem to always be adhered to strictly. There is a theistic
and an atheistic&nbsp;branch.</p>
<p>To the atheistic branch, Satan is a symbol and an ideal. It is also not the
same Satan as the one in Christian literature, as atheists don&#8217;t believe in any
religion, including Christianity. This is more of a set of life principles than
a pronouncement of belief. In this situation Satan represents ideas like
freethought, individualism, rational self-interest. Not much of this is
abhorrent or offensive. These people seem to be the majority of Satanists
today, under a few different&nbsp;groups.</p>
<p>Then there are the theistic ones. For most of these guys too, their definition
of Satan is not tied to its (his?) portrayal in Christian literature. A few say
that theirs <em>is</em> the same Satan, but that Satan was falsely accused, betrayed
and banished by God. In either case Satan is not evil incarnate, unlike what
some of the vocal opponents of the Harvard Mass seem to think. Heresy, sure.
But then one can say that about most non-Christian-conforming ideas. And
sometimes even other Christians, like the Protestants, were accused of the&nbsp;same.</p>

</div>
<p>As far as I know, even to the theists, the black-mass Christian-mockery
devil-ritual group are labelled as wannabes, and jokingly called &quot;reverse
Christians&quot; because their beliefs in Satan is based on its (his?) portrayal in
Christian literature. And it is this group who is really committing the
arguably insulting heresy of&nbsp;Christianity.</p>
<p>The others are reactionary towards Christianity maybe in their syncretic choice
of idol (and who else to react against but one of the largest religions ever?),
but ultimately have nothing to do with the Christian Satan. It&#8217;s a different&nbsp;thing.</p>
<div class="section" id="on-the-black-mass">
<h3>On the Black&nbsp;Mass</h3>
<p>The origins of the Black Mass are murky, but seem to be rooted mainly in the
Middle Ages, starting as church satire. Probably the most famous practicians of
this early form of satire were the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goliard">Goliards</a>, who wrote the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmina_Burana">Carmina Burana</a>!
The Goliards were a group of clergy who were increasingly discontent with
alleged abuses in the Church, and decided to express this with satire and parody.
They had a Feast of The Ass where they brought a costumed Donkey in the church
and engaged in festivities. There were other forms of this mocking of
Christianity, such as drinker&#8217;s masses and gamblers&#8217; masses. But about the
Black Mass specifically, there seems to be evidence that it stems from the
later Christian tradition of witch hunting. Two famous tomes on the subject,
the &quot;Malleus Maleficarum&quot; and the &quot;Compendium Maleficarum&quot; mention masses
subverted for evil purposes. (Of course, we now know that most of the material
in these books are completely invented and preposterous.) From there, it takes
off and makes its way into literature, until finally in the 1900s religious
freedom blooms, and the first &quot;out&quot; satanists start forming their own churches
and religions, and derive their own&nbsp;rituals.</p>
<p>Apparently, a recent revival of Satanphobia came by during the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satanic_ritual_abuse">Satanic Ritual
Abuse</a> scare, which was mostly baseless moral panic. I won&#8217;t go into the
details here, but it&#8217;s a very interesting read if you&#8217;d like to know fear and
ignorance can devolve into mass&nbsp;hysteria.</p>
<p>Given how closely satanic abuse was studied because of the scare, it&#8217;s
interesting that people can only point to a handful of examples of
self-described satanists causing harm, a feat no major religion can claim (and
I&#8217;m being liberal here, including those who are mentally ill and those who are
merely posing and do not actually believe in some form of Satanism). Let us
pause here for a moment to recall recent unsavory learnings regarding the
Archdiocese of Boston, and then regarding the Catholic Church in general, not
to mention hundreds of years of&nbsp;history.</p>

</div>
<p>Another point is that it is doubtful that most of the attendees are Satanists!
There are an estimated 50000 Satanists in the <span class="caps">US</span>, which makes for around 1 in
10000 people. Besides, it&#8217;s the Cultural Studies Club, and it&#8217;s a reenactment.
Civil war reenactment is not the civil war, renaissance fairs are not the
renaissance, when the Boston Opera House shows Faust, no real deal with the
Devil takes&nbsp;place.</p>
<p>Continuing on, here&#8217;s a list of what I bet won&#8217;t happen at this event: Human or
animal sacrifice, bloodletting, abuse. I also really doubt that there will be
any &quot;death to Christians&quot; type speech, even as part of the reenactment. Here is
a group of people who agreed to not use a consecrated host as part of the&nbsp;ceremony.</p>
<p>After a bit of digging, I&#8217;ve <a class="reference external" href="http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2014/5/11/black-mass-extension-school/?page=single">found</a> that they&#8217;re recreating a ritual in a novel
called &quot;<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A0-bas_%28novel%29">Là-bas</a>&quot;, which is a fictional&nbsp;account:</p>
<blockquote>
&quot;Although a work of fiction, Huysmans&#8217; description of the Black Mass
remained influential simply because no other book went into as much detail.
However, the actual text which Huysmans&#8217; satanic &quot;priest&quot; recites is
nothing more than a long diatribe in French, praising Satan as the god of
reason and the opponent of Christianity. In this way, it resembles the
French poetry of Charles Baudelaire (in particular Les Litanies de Satan),
more than it resembles an inversion of the Roman Catholic Mass.&quot;
&#8212; Wikipedia, &quot;<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Mass#Early_modern_France">Black Mass</a>&quot;</blockquote>
<p>Make no mistake, it&#8217;s not <em>just</em> a diatribe. But it&#8217;s not a &quot;real&quot; ritual. To
me, it&#8217;s not a stretch to consider this event a theatrical depiction. Although
Judgding by the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_The_Da_Vinci_Code#Christian_response">response</a> of the Church to The Da Vinci Code, even clear
works of fiction are not allowed to&nbsp;insult.</p>

</div>
<p>I find it patronizing when the Archdiocese <a class="reference external" href="https://www.facebook.com/BostonCatholic/posts/10152046898552606">suggests</a> that a theatrical
depiction is &quot;dangerously close&quot; to destructive works of evil, and weak when
<a class="reference external" href="http://catholicpreaching.com/letter-to-harvard-president-drew-g-faust-about-the-satanic-mass-to-take-place-on-the-campus-of-harvard/">Father Landry</a> brings up the conjuration of the spirit of Hitler in what I
hope is conscious&nbsp;hyperbole.</p>
<p>Another thing I find curious is that of all the denominations of nearby
Christian churches, only officials from the Catholic Church seemed to object. I
don&#8217;t know enough about the different ideological stances of the different
denominations to consider that more&nbsp;deeply.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="on-mockery">
<h3>On&nbsp;Mockery</h3>
<p>This brings us to the charges of Mockery. I think what keeps being missed is
that Mockery need not imply hate speech. An example: Colbert mocks Republicans
all the time, as I&#8217;m sure the Republicans mock back. It&#8217;s a form of parody,
like when Tina Fey did her Sarah Palin impression. Sure, there is friction, but
political parody and mockery is an ancient tradition. If conflict escalates,
it&#8217;s rarely because of a caricature. How can a peaceful mocking relationship
exist among dogged rivals of deeply held political beliefs, while religious
mockery is somehow unacceptable and seems to claim lives on a regular&nbsp;basis?</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315"
src="//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/IE-OCDexYrU" frameborder="0"
allowfullscreen></iframe>
<br /><p>In my humble opinion, most other religions are a mockery of Christianity as
much as Christianity is a mockery of them. It&#8217;s easy to observe the utter
incompatibility in ideals, maxims, beliefs. At the very least most other
religions are blasphemy to Christianity. Sometimes, for example, religions will
explicitly pronounce all other religions, including Christianity, false! Is
this not an affront and insult? And yet most modern Christians are somehow not
visibly offended by other religions and their rituals on a daily basis. Does
the Archdiocese, for example, object to daily Buddhist meditation or Muslim
prayer? Has there ever been a stink raised about either being&nbsp;offensive?</p>
<p>If it ever was, it would be when these religions were not well established,
small in number, unknown and obscure. And therein lies my&nbsp;contempt.</p>
<p>Putting aside the rationale for the public brouhaha, I think the sole reason
the Archdiocese is able to object to any ritual without people calling <em>them</em>
intolerant is that the target is a small and historically demonized group. Who
would defend the&nbsp;Satanists?</p>

</div>
<p>If merely practicing a ritual is offensive (reminding again that it&#8217;s very
unlikely that any abuse or hate speech will happen at this specific event, and
that it&#8217;s merely a reenactment), then they could at least be consistent and
object to all other&nbsp;rituals.</p>
<p>Aside from a Shaker exhibition, I read that the club is also planning a Shinto
tea ceremony and a Buddhist meditation. I&#8217;m eager to see if there will be any
reactions to&nbsp;those.</p>
