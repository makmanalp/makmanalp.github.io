</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>The genre of historical painting is an interesting one. Its defining
characteristic is that the paintings are a snapshot of a historic moment, a
recounting of a&nbsp;story.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="Liberty Leading The People" src="img/stanczyk/liberty.jpg" style="width: 400px;" />
<p class="caption"><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_Leading_the_People#mediaviewer/File:Eug%C3%A8ne_Delacroix_-_La_libert%C3%A9_guidant_le_peuple.jpg">Liberty Leading the People</a>&nbsp;(1830)</p>
</div>
<p>It seems that somehow this once prolific genre has mostly been replaced by
journalistic photography, which performs an analogous but slightly different
task. The limitation with photography for this purpose is that while it&#8217;s
easier to convey a moment, it&#8217;s more difficult to expound on the context and
narrative surrounding it. With painting though, one has greater freedom to tell
the story the way <em>they</em> want to tell it, and decide to choose elements of the
story they deem relevant and irrelevant. In that sense, historical painting is
not unlike a textual&nbsp;retelling.</p>
<p>Inevitably, with the ability to freely guide narrative in historic events comes
political commentary. The Polish painter <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Matejko">Jan Matejko</a>, considered to be one
of Poland&#8217;s best, is a master of this form of&nbsp;commentary.</p>
<p>During the 19th century Polish lands were occupied by Russia, Prussia and
Austria, and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth ceased to exist. Russia and
Austria engaged in explicit anti-Polish activity, including banning the
language in schools, in an effort to stamp out nationalistic disagreement. A
fervent patriot, Matejko wanted to aid his country in the January Uprising of
1863 against Russia, but was not healthy enough to do so. Instead, he donated
most of his savings, carried arms, and painted&nbsp;pictures.</p>
<p>While independent Poland didn&#8217;t exist during the 18th century, Matejko&#8217;s
paintings won awards in Europe, helped spread awareness of the political events
that took place and reminded the world of Poland&#8217;s national&nbsp;cause.</p>
<p>One of my favourite paintings of all time is Matejko&#8217;s rendition of <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sta%C5%84czyk">Stanczyk</a>
(which I&#8217;ll talk more about in a bit). The court jester to three Polish kings
in the 15th and 16th centuries, Stanczyk was a controversial figure. While he
was indeed an entertainer, he was also known and revered by his contemporaries
during the Renaissance as a great political thinker who used his humor and wit
to make politicians aware of their&nbsp;follies.</p>
<p>The most famous Stanczyk anecdote is about an incident that happened during a&nbsp;hunt:</p>
<blockquote>
&quot;In 1533 King Sigismund the Old had a huge bear brought for him from
Lithuania. The bear was released in the forest of Niepolomice near Kraków
so that the king could hunt it. During the hunt, the animal charged at the
king, the queen and their courtiers which caused panic and mayhem. Queen
Bona fell from her horse which resulted in her miscarriage. Later, the king
criticized Stanczyk for having run away instead of attacking the bear. The
jester is said to have replied that &#8216;it is a greater folly to let out a
bear that was already in a cage&#8217;. This remark is often interpreted as an
allusion to the king&#8217;s policy toward Prussia which was defeated by Poland
but not fully incorporated into the Crown.&quot;
&#8212; Wikipedia, &quot;<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sta%C5%84czyk">Stanczyk</a>&quot;</blockquote>
<div class="figure">
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="img/stanczyk/prussian_homage.jpg"><img alt="Prussian Homage" src="img/stanczyk/prussian_homage.jpg" style="width: 400px;" /></a>
<p class="caption"><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prussian_Homage_%28painting%29#mediaviewer/File:Prussian_Homage.jpg">Prussian Homage</a>&nbsp;(1881)</p>
</div>
<p>Sure enough, in a painting Matejko made of the Prussian Homage, an event where
the duke of Prussia swore allegiance to the king of Poland, Stanczyk can be
seen sitting below the king with a skeptical expression. The duke of Prussia is
kneeling on both knees, which appears to be to be a symbol of his insincerity
and disloyalty, since dukes only kneeled with both knees in front of&nbsp;God.</p>
<p>But this is separate from Matejko&#8217;s original rendition of Stanczyk, which is
perhaps his most famous painting. Pause a second and click to take a closer&nbsp;look:</p>
<div class="figure">
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="img/stanczyk/stanczyk_large.jpg"><img alt="Stanczyk during a ball at the court of Queen Bona in the face of the loss of Smolensk" src="img/stanczyk/stanczyk.jpg" style="width: 400px;" /></a>
<p class="caption">Stanczyk during a ball at the court of Queen Bona in the face of the loss of Smolensk&nbsp;(1862)</p>
</div>
<p>Here, Stanczyk sits alone in deep contemplation, perhaps worry. He wears a
fool&#8217;s outfit, complete with bells and pointy hat, but is he really such a
fool? Behind him, in the other room, everyone else is partaking in a lively
celebration but he has no appetite for it. His marotte (a jester&#8217;s scepter with
a miniature head on it) is tossed on the ground. On the table lies a letter
with an official seal. It was presumably crumpled up by someone else, since
Stanczyk seems concerned about&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>The text on the letter mentions Smolensk, a reference to the loss of Smolensk
to the Russians in 1514, which is what Stanczyk is worried about, but no one
else seems to grasp the importance of. Smolensk is quite close to Moscow, the
capital of Russia. At its height, the Polish-Lithuanian commonwealth was a
significant power that could hold such lands. Everyone else doesn&#8217;t doubt the
continuation of this power, as they celebrate the victorious Battle of Orsha
that happened around the same&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>The loss of Smolensk, however, marks a change in the tides of power. There is a
comet in the sky that can be seen through the window. This is an omen of things
to come. An entertainer with dwarfism plays a musical instrument: Dwarfism at
the time would symbolize people of lower standing and caliber, suggesting the
character of the kind of rulers who would celebrate while danger is&nbsp;ahead.</p>
<div class="figure">
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="img/stanczyk/matejko.jpg"><img alt="Jan Matejko" src="img/stanczyk/matejko.jpg" style="width: 400px;" /></a>
<p class="caption"><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Matejko#mediaviewer/File:Jan_Matejko.JPG">Jan Matejko by Jules Mien</a> (before&nbsp;1883)</p>
</div>
<p>Finally, Stanczyk&#8217;s facial features match Matejko&#8217;s own. This whole picture is
an allusion to the emotions Matejko had towards the fate of his country while
it was under&nbsp;invasion.</p>
<p>The most appealing part of Stanczyk is that he defies the stereotypes of the
philosopher, the politician and the patriot, while being all three:
Philosophers are supposed to be formal and sober, while Stanczyk is witty and
jovial. Kings and other politicians dress and carry themselves with gravitas,
and expect to be treated accordingly, while Stanczyk wears a self-deprecating
fool&#8217;s costume with bells. The avowed patriots are at the ball celebrating
Poland&#8217;s victory, while Stanczyk worries alone in a room for its&nbsp;future.</p>
